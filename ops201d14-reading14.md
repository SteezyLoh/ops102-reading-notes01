**1  What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software?** 
- The main difference between anti-virus and anti-malware is that no anti-virus can scan a million maleare types and variants. You run Anti-virus to scam to see if there are any malwares that infected the computer

- You can tell if youre PC is infected due to it being more slow and more errors or even cant open up website that you usually have up

**3 Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software.**
