# Readings: Traffic Mirroring
Traffic mirror is very important because its a way you can monitor traffic 
**What are the differences between SPAN and TAP?**
- Span can be access remotely to where tap is a hardware device which can passively capture traffic on a network. Span is a method of monitoring traffic

**2. What types of network devices can support network traffic mirroring?**
- TAP which stands for Terminal Access Point. It is a device that supports network traffic.

**3. How can network traffic mirroring be used for network security?**
- Network traffic mirroring can be used for network security because it can monitor every single packet that comes in traffic from each vlan and whatever port that is traveling too.

**4. Are there any legal or ethical considerations when using network traffic mirroring?**
- I would think that it would be a legal issue if we track every packet that is on the network traffic for no reason. Maybe it is legal if a company was involved in a cyber attack then that is probably the only reason it is allows to monitor traffic. But then again i am not so sure.
