# 401 Reading Notes 02
## Cloud security principles and framework
This topic matters because AWS and cloud network is the future
**1. Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.**
- The Abstraction leves in AWS are what divides the consumer space and the provided space that is managed by AWS. It makes it even to have space in the cloud.

**2. What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?**
- The control plane focuses on the management and orchestration aspects of containers, while the data plane is responsible for the actual execution and networking of containers. Together, they provide a robust and scalable environment for deploying and running containerized applications in the cloud.

**3. Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?**
- AWS Lambda allows you to upload your code and it let AWS figure how to run it on the scale.

## I would love to learn more about the cloud. I know that we are just scratching the surface but i am looking forward to learning more about all things cloud.
