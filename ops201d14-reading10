  <dt>What is Backup and Disaster Recovery (BDR). And why is it essential for busisiness?</dt>
  <dd>Backup and Disaster recovery are two different things but so related when it comes to work in the field. Everyclient should have a BDR plan just in case somthing happens.</dd>

  <dt>Decribe the data backup in detail.</dt>
  <dd>Backup data is the process of storing a copt of a clients data either in the cloud or IRL with a flash drive or hard drive</dd>

<dt>What does disaster recovery refer to. And why is it crucial to have it in addition to data backups?</dt>
  <dd>Disaster recovery is like if there was a poweroutage or a storm and having a disaster recovery is having all the data restore back into life. Although some may come back automatically. It is always safe to have a plan</dd>

  <dt>What is cloud backup and recovery. And how does it enhance data security?</dt>
  <dd>Cloud backup and recovery is backing up data and apps to the cloud(Not pysically)and then restoring files and data if there is a disaster or a attack when you need to delete them. In cybersecuirty backups are very important so having a backup for a backup is a must</dd>

  <dt>In some cultures, the concept od data privacy is highly valued. While in other, Sharing information openly is considered normal. How might these cultural norms affect the way individuals approach data backup and disaster data recovery? Provide examples to support your response</dt>
  <dd>I believe with any cultures or orginizations that backing up important informations is key. Some families would not want their important information to be out there like that. Think of it like a social secuirty card or a bank account number. I know we humans tend to forget where we place things so its important that we have a back up place for our important stuff that is safe where we can access it only incase we forget things.</dd>
