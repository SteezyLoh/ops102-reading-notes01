## Pass the Hash with Mimikatz

**1. Name the six credential-gathering techniques which Mimikatz is able to perform and explain how two of them work.**
- Pass-the-hash - Attackers use Mimikatz to pass an exact hash string to log in to the target computer
- Pass-the-ticket - Mimikatz provides functionality for a user to pass a Kerberos ticket to another computer an log in with that user's ticket. 
- Overpass-the-hash(pass-the-key)
- kerberoast golden tickets
- Kerberoast silver tickets
- Pass-the-cache


**2. What are four ways we can defend against Mimikatz attacks. Explain how two of the mitigations can stop Mimikatz.**
- Change admin privileges - This can be done by imiting admin privileges to only user who need them
- Change caching policy - Windows caches password hashes that were recently used through their system registry. Mimikatz can then gain access to these cached passwords, which is why itâ€™s important to change your default settings to cache zero recent passwords. This can be accessed through Windows Settings > Local Policy > Security Options > Interactive Logon.  
- Turn off deugging privileges
- Increase local security authority
