### Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need? 
I would say the more Core because the more core you have the more speed in gigahertz your computer will be. Meaning that it can handle more data and handle more apps, etc all at once. That means it will be faster and better
### What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
Finding the same motherboard that is comptaible with the CPU by chcecking if the socket. That way you can tell if the mother board is right for the CPU and some mother boards come with wifi, bluetooth, etc
### What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
With the SSD it is very much smaller and gives more room to the motherboard. They are also faster then HDD and is only a chip rather than a moving disk. HDD on the other hand dont need a SATA cable which SSD do.
### Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
Alot of people with my background have little to non PC knowledge. So i would tell them the very bare minimum and tell them that everything is connected to the motherboard. And usually more times then not, the CPU will be in the center and the CPU is the brain of the computer

## Things i want to know more about
I really want to know more about how the SATA cables and also want to be more good at calculating binary numbers
