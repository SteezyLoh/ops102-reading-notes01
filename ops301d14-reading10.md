## VPC
VPC is very important because it is important to know what time of network a company uses

**1. How can one host within a VPC any services that need to be public?**
-VPC is like reserving a private spot on the internet. It is at the end of the day the internet. Although it private it is still hosted by the public (Internet)

**2. What are examples of services that would live in the publicly-accessible part of the VPC? The privately-accessible part?**
- A public cloud is also called a mutitenancy. It means where other tenant can share the same resources. A private cloud only has a single tenant. 

- Public clouds key technology is Subnets,VLAN and VPN. Vs a private cloud where it has better scalability and is a easier hybrid cloud deployment. And better performance and of course better security 

**3. What are the trade-offs of using a VPC vs traditional infrastructure?**
- VPC is private and if you were working for a company then it would be best to use VPC to keep all the clients data secure. It would bring less attention most of the time away for attacks
