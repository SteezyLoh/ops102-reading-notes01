## Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

HIDS and NIDS are very important when it comes to security in a network because you would want to see who is trying to get into the system and it logs and monitor it for you

**1. List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS?**
- The way i think of it is IDS is like a smoke alarm or the Dogs in the property that notify's the owner that someone who is not familiar is on the property. Which a firewall is like the great wall of china back in the day. Nobody was to go pass those walls who were not welcome. So IDS means alert, and keep track of who is coming in by logging and report and firewall is to keep bad guys from coming in. Like a bouncer at a club not letting the under age people get in.

**2. Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS?**
- If i was at in organization that wanted to track TCP headers in real time i would go with NIDS. But if i wanted to see who was making changes in the network that were unauthorized i would go with HIDS. Also HIDS would monitor and audit logs and compare new entires and attack signatures. 

**3. Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS?**
-  Wouldnt be able to tell who is unauthorized user making changes to the system file
- Monitor event audit logs
- Additional hardware is required.

## I wish i knew more about how they implement NID And HIDS in a company and which companies uses HIDS or NIDS or both. I would also want to know what kind of tools they use. What are the tools called?
