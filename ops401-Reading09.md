## Public Key Infrastructure (PLI)

**1.Name the three main components which make up PKI.**
- Entities - These are individuals or device that have cryptographic keys associated with them, serving as their digital identity in a digital network

**2.How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.**
- A key is like a password to something that only the person with that password can open up and add,change, do whatever with that kind of stuff. And whatever that thing is, its very important because it requires a key.

**3.What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?**
- The main weakness of public PKI is that any certificate authority can sign a certificate for any person or computer. Certificate authorities exist in many countries, some of which have rather authoritarian or even potentially hostile governments. Sometimes certificate authorities create or are coerced to create certificates for parties they have no business vouching for.
