## Data file encryption
CIA triad in like the base of security. To stop threat actors from trying to attack data files we must know what Hashing and what encryption means.
**1. You have been made responsible for the companyâ€™s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad?**
- If i were to be made responsible for a company's file server and was to implement the CIA triad i would start off with Encryption. Obviously our data is our top priority so i would add encryption so that if anyone would want to read our data they would have to decrypt it themselves. We will use hashes to secure our data if we want to send it to others in our company. Fot availability we would run two servers just in case one goes down or in the event of a natural disaster. This is known as the active passive high availability configuration 

**2. Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.**
- Hashing is like a secret password you give to someone who you want only them to see what you send. This determines if the files that was received was tampered along the way

**3. How is hashing and encryption different?**
- So Hashing is like getting a tattoo. There is no way you can turn your skin back to normal because you cannot undo a hash. Encryption on the other had you can decrypt so there for you can always undo an it. Hashing give you a code.

## I wish i knew more in debt or get more hands on in debt with hashing and encryption in general.
