  <dt>What makes the Linksys WRT54GL famous</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Given it’s age, why do people continue to buy the Linksys WRT54GL?</dt>
  <dd>A few reason why i think people buy it is beacuse it works and has never stopepd working. And its easy to use. I like to say it has all the clout.
  Its like how Nike came out with airforce ones. A very simple shoe thats been out since 1982 yet people still popular till this day</dd>
<dt>What does the “WRT54GL” stand for in the name?</dt>
<dd>WRT54GL stands for Wireless rounter. And then they put in L on it and the L stood for linux because they wanted it to be a linux router and the number
54 was for the Mbps and 802.11G</dd>
<dt>What did Linksys sell before routers?</dt>
<dd>Linksys sold a producted that could connect multiple PC that connected to routers. I remember this specifically becasue  i had a friend with
the WRT54GL and he told me about it</dd>
<dt>When did Linksys preview their first consumer router?</dt>
<dd>I believe they sold their first WRT54G in December of 2002 from what i read</dd>

<dd>The almight king of the PNW(Pacific North West)Seattles very own OG mr tripple OG Uncle Bill</dd>
<dt>What happened when Cisco replaced the Linux-based firmware with the VxWorks platform?</dt>
<dd>There was alot of protest behind it after Cisco bought Linksys and replace Linux firmware with VxWorks making it hard beacuse everyone was use to an open source firmware
like linux</dd>
<dt>Why doesn’t the WRT54GL model need to be modified to abide by the new FCC rules?</dt>
<dd>The WRT54GL didnt need to be motified because Cisco lost the case by the FSF because they didnt provide source code and they had to pay FSF</dd>
<dt>Does the WRT54GL model still get updates from Linksys?</dt>
<dd>YES, the WRT54GL still get update from time to time from Linksys</dd>
<dt>Things i wish i knew more about</dt>
