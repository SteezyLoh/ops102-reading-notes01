## China's spy kit

### How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?Links to an external site.
The hardwark hack that Chinas used was in a hardware attacked meaning that it was piece of hardware rather then a software where you had to download.

### What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?Links to an external site.
If a spy wanted to alter computer hardware they could place malicious hardware such as how China did with the motherboards. Also they can be altered but other hardware divices such as a USB. The USB can be very dangerous if we plug it into our computer because it may have malicious data on it.

### Explain how the hack worked.Links to an external site.
From what i have read, Amazon was using services from a Hardware company based out of Portland, OR for their streaming (Amazon Prime Video). But later did some digging and found a very small chip in the motherboard. The hack made it so it can open doors for other attackers and made the company more vulnerable.

### How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?Links to an external site.
CIA traced where the hardware came from and they saw that the manufacturer. They found out that Chinas was the most probably cause of the chip because most of the hardware in the world came from china
