## CompTIA A+ 220-902 Troubleshooting Methology

<dl>
  <dt>What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during touble shooting?</dt>
  <dd>If mutilply issues accuring all at once than its better off to breaking those probablems piece by piece. I would start with the most easist one and work my way up to the more deficult ones as i go </dd>

  <dt>What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the trouleshooting process?</dt>
  <dd>If i were to solve a solution from troubleshooting i would implement the problem. I would document everything from the begaining. That way whenever something was successful i would put a note in case a simular situation occurs i can use the tool i used with i fixed the situation before.</dd>

<dt>What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in knowledge base?</dt>
<dd>Benifits of documenting is just like how i said in the previous question above. I know that if i document it i can always look back and it is also a good thing to because the client and your coworkers or whoever you work with can network and help eachh other solve the probablem in case the probablem comes up on thier end</dd>

<dt>Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise. How would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodolgy to help. WHile considering the end-user's cultural background?</dt>
<dd>I couldnt speak for my culture because technogly is not favored. So i would have to speak on my community. And i would say from where i live alot of people have Apple Iphones and If they had an issue and ask me to trouble shoot it i would take the nessassry steps to solve the probablem. First i would start with the basic by turning it on or off. Than i would try to plug it into my mac to see if there is anything wrong with it all while i am documenting. I will use all my resourses like the internet and chatGPT. If that wouldnt fix it i will have to call apple and take it upon their hands</dd>
