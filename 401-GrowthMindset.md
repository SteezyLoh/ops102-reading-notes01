# Growth Mindset

**The topic of growth mindset is very important and is very relatable to what I am studying because we are being exposed to something new. And sometimes learning new things can be a challenge
we can either run from it or grow from it, So that's why this topic is very important. I have had times in my life where i was forced into using a growth mindset instead of a fix one and i'm glad 
I did it because I grew from it. I previously worked with my family in the care field where I was new at and I used a growth mindset to get familiar with the workflow. I had learn that having a growth
mindset creates new neural-pathways in your brain. Growth mindset also helps you get away from a fixed mindset because I truly believe the fixed mindset is the devil telling you lies.**

## I wish i knew more why people are so comfortable with a fixed mindset
