## Sniffing and Evasion

**1. Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.**
- A sniffing attack is used on the network. When a user request data from the server a sniffer can use get inbetween all that process and repeatingly send data back to overwhelm the users endpoint

**2. What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?**
- Passive Sniffing: Quiet and less detectable but limited by network type.
- Active Sniffing: More aggressive and detectable, effective on various networks.

**3. How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?**
- It protects traffic by encoding the data, so it is unreadable to the attacker unless they have the key
