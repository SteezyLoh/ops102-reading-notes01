# Ops401 Reading Notes 03
## Cyber Risk Analysis
This top is important because it all ties with the CIA triad 

**1. Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?**
- An ATM can Incorporate to cover Confidentiality, Integrity and the Availability from the CIA triad. But mostly confidentiality and availability   Confidentiality because not everyone should have access to your bank information. Integrity to prevent intentional or malicious modification and protect sensitive info. 

**2. Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.**
- Separation duties
- Mandatory vacations
- Job Rotation

**3. What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stageâ€™s main goal or objective?**
- Risk assessment: Categorize, classify and evaluate assets, as well as identify threats and vulnerabilities
- Risk analysis: Both qualitative and quantitative
- Risk mitigation/response: Includes reducing or avoiding risk, transferring risk, and accepting or rejecting risk

I wish i knew more about other ways bug companies get hacked even when they have all the CIA triad and risk managements up to date
