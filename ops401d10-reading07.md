## Protect Data at rest with device encryption

**1. From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.**
- Data at rest -  is like when I am not working. When i am not sending emails or done anything. Its like if i had a file full of data and i had it saved on my computer and not sending it or even opening it to say the least 

- Data at transit - I think of data in transit as if it was like something in motion. If i was sending email and someone was to intercept it. Key word is transit, Moving one place to another.  

**2. Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.**
- Confidentiality - Must be decrypted with a key to ba able to read.
- Integrity - Ensures that information remains to accurate and unaltered during storage, processing or transmission
- Abailbility - Ensures that data encrypted is accessible and usable when needed.

# I wish i can learn more about how data at rest can be comprised  while at rest.
