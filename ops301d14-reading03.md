## Network Segmentation

These things are very important because network segmentation knowledge helps secure network 

**What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?**
- CIDR repremsents CIDR blocking which is a range of IP addresses. 

**How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?**
- 

**Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?**
- ip has 8 bit decimal octets sperated by dots. But all four of the octet add up to 32 btis

**What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?**
- the "/" represents how many bits make up the mask.

**How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?**
- 65,536

## What is Network Segmentation and why it matters

**In your own words, describe network segmentation.**
- Network Segmentation is like a big collection of shoes. Im a sneaker head so each brand and color goes with each other and the other. Never mix the brand that the number rule as a sneaker head. So segmentation is me making sure they dont ever mix.

**Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?**
- I believe even with a configured firewall, Network segmentation is very important because it devides the network so there are other ways to recover when attacked

**What is a screened subnet?**
- From what i read i believe that screened submet is a screen or a layer of the subnet.

**Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?**
- Physical secuirty. 


## Things i wish i knew more about 
I know i can learn more i know we are just "scratching the surface but i wish i had more time to study this.
