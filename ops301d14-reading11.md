## Windows Server

**1. What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesnâ€™t know much about computers?**
- A server is like its own computer. But the server is in charge of keeping all things organize. Many do not have that time or skill to manage everything that is going on in the operating system. There are a lot of things that are happening when we send or receive  data. We need a server to help us with that. Saves a lot of time and effort.

**2. How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?**
- You cannot sign into your Microsoft account is you were on the windows server vs when you are on windows 10. Meaning you cannot share the same credentials as if you were on windows 10 with the server. Windows server can also disable updates through out groups on windows 10

**3. Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?**
-  Windows server has more powerful hardware. Windows 10 has a max of only 2TB of RAM. Windows Server allows 24 TB. Nobody is even considered to even be possible to carry that amoint of RAM on a user end point. Basically a server is going to have more powerful specs vs the windows desktop user.
