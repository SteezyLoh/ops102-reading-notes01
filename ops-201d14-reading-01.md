  <dt>How long does it usually take to use the System Restore tool in Windows?</dt>
  <dd>The system resore tool shouldnt take long at all. It should be very simple with just going to the sysytem secuirty settings uder the system protection tab. It should only take 10-30 minutes</dd>

  <dt>How do you start a System Restore from the command prompt?</dt>
<dd>If you type in "rstrui.exe" in the command prompt and follow the instructions. It should allow you to restore it that way </dd>

  <dt>What options are available if System Restore did not fix the problem?</dt>
  <dd>You can use a free data recocvery software tools. I believe you can find a number of them on the interrnet. I personally have never used one but just like many things some are going to be quite if not a little better than others</dd>
