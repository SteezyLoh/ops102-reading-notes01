These things are important because security in the cloud is very important. And the future is shifting towards the use of the cloud.

**1. Explain CloudWatch Events to a non-technical friend.**
-  Cloudwatch Events are events that live in the cloud. So picture a computer living on the internet. That computer need to have security measures implemented in it so that important stuff on the computer does not get compromised. Cloudwatch monitors those computers and they even keep track of the time that are used so that if someone who was not allow to be on the cloud computer they would know what time or date they were on and keep track of all the stuff that they did during those time. 

**2. What do CloudWatch Logs helps us achieve?**
- CloudWatch Logs helps users to access, monitor & store access log files from AWS. They use CloudWatch to search up any suspicious patters or logs. CloudWatch logs are a managed service that can be provisioned without extra purchases from within your AWS accounts. The logs can also trigger alerts.

**3.What capabilities does CloudWatch Anomaly detection have?**
- With CloudWatch Anomaly detection it can learn and model the expected behavior of a metric based on prior data. It also can calculate values and generates the Anomaly Detection band. And it enables to create alarms. 

## Things i wish i knew more about are when was cloudwatch implemented and how to use it.
