This is important to know because proxy are what run a companies network

**1. What are the benefits of a forward proxy?**
- Avoid state or institutional browsing restrictions - Some governments, schools, and other organizations use firewalls to give their users access to a limited version of the Internet. A forward proxy can be used to get around these restrictions, as they let the user connect to the proxy rather than directly to the sites they are visiting. 
- Block access to certain content - Proxies can block others from accessing different website. Or should i say block some website that the business finds non useful
- Protect their identity online - Proxies can be used to protect the users information from the website. 

**2. Explain the differences between a forward and a reverse proxy?**
- Forward proxy is like when a user tries to connect to a server the forward proxy is like the middle man. The user tries to connect to the internet by connecting to the server but before they even connect to the internet they go through the forward proxy first. With Reverse proxy the user connected to the internet first then the reverse proxy intercepts the request and then forwards it to the server.

**3. Explain to your manager why your organization might benefit from implementing a reverse proxy?**
-  There are a lot of benefits we can use to implement a reverse proxy server. One of the reasons why is load balancing. Reverse proxy can help with overflow traffic on the network. It can help filter traffic that is coming in by balancing out loads to different servers so that way not one server is taking all the work while the other one is chilling because that would cause a network issue. 

## I wonder what is more popular and forward proxy or a reverse proxy. And what are the big company's using. Im guessing its reverse but i still want to know.
