# VPN Tunnel
** VPN are very important because if you work for a business that a lot important data and you use normal internet traffic then packets can be lost or stolen from threat actors who are port sniffing.

**What is a site-to-site VPN?**
- A site to site VPN is a connection that is between more than one network. It is usually for one company that work wants to keep their network private. And don't want any outside traffic flowing in their network.Helpful for Companies that have a big space or or is spread out.


**What is TCP/IP and what is it used for?**
- TCP is used to know how data if all the packets moving in the tunnel have been received from one end to another. I think of the TCP pack as the inventory guy working at a warehouse distribution center. If the packet is damaged or broken or more often then not missing, Then TCP send its back and waits for another so that the end user can receive all the packets.

**What are some popular reasons for using a VPN?**
- Some reasons that VPN is very useful is because its like a private tunnel that the outside cant really see. I think of it like using the back roads instead of the city. When you drive to the back road instead of the city it is clear and not a lot traffic. The city traffic(main road) is more "messy" a lot other stuff can happen. Very vulnerable  to a company that has a lot of sensitive data.

**Explain the difference between the three types of VPNs.**
- Site to site VPN - Connected to the internet (WAN). Use for company that is large
- Client to site - Connected to the internet (LAN). Using home or other networks like hotel , coffeeshop or at home connected to the network for a company.
- Commercial VPN - Creates a tunnel that you can use to send a receive data so that the government don't see or anybody can see. Can be use to bypass some firewalls.
