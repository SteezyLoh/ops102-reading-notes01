**2. Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the companyâ€™s leadership. How would you lead this conversation?**
- I would explain to my manager that the only true way to test our security is by hiring pentesters to come and work on our systems. I would tell my manager to keep it a secret or maybe tell them to hire me to do the test so I can put on my resume that I have pentesting skills.
